## ‚úàÔ∏è Overview

![ably aggrid banner](./ably-aggrid.png)

This repository showcases a demo of a real-time data grid that allows multiple users to collaborate and work on the same grid simultaneously. The example is built using React.js, Ag-grid, Tailwind, and HeroIcons.

By integrating Ably's real-time messaging technology, this example provides a reliable and scalable communication infrastructure, making it possible for multiple users to collaborate seamlessly in real-time.

If you want to see how it works, you can try out the [live demo](https://ag-grid-ably.vercel.app) of the collaborative data grid. Simply open the link and start interacting with the grid to see how multiple users can work together on the same grid.

This example is a great starting point for anyone who wants to build their own collaborative data grid, and Ably's real-time messaging technology can be used to create other real-time features in your applications. To learn more, check out Ably's other real-time examples and discover how you can build real-time features into your applications with ease.
