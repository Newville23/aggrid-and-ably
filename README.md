## ‚úàÔ∏è Overview

![ably aggrid banner](./ably-aggrid.png)

This repository showcases how to integrate Ably and Ag-grid into a React app to create a powerful, real-time collaborative data grid. With this example, you can experience a unique, interactive data grid that supports multiple users simultaneously and see their actions in real-time. You can try out the [live demo](https://ag-grid-ably.vercel.app) of the collaborative data grid to see it in action.

The example is built with React.js, Ag-grid, Tailwind, and HeroIcons, making it a great starting point for building your own collaborative data grid. Ably's real-time messaging technology provides a reliable and scalable communication infrastructure, enabling multiple users to collaborate seamlessly.
